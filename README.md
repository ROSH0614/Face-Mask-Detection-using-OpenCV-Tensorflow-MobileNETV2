# Face-Mask-Detection-using-OpenCV-Tensorflow-MobileNETV2
Detecting face masks using Python, Keras, OpenCV on real video streams
we have data set which contains images of different people with mask and people without mask
Loading the requirements.txt package on to the system 
TensorFlow,keras,computer vision packages are imported 
realtime camera is been used for taking snapshots of the same but turned into video 
since we have different dataset for mask and no mask categories we did concentrate on both with two different algorithm to tackle the same
we also used facedetector so as to recognise face and also added colours to it 
finally deployed model using the primary camera of the system with mask and without mask
